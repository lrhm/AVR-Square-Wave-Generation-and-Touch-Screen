this is my final project of AVR Micro controller class . Written in C . by touching touch screen, a frequency is made through buzzer . something like a music instrument .
square wave is created by timer . and data from touch screen is given trough ADC.
Objects used in this project :
* AVR Micro Controller ATMEGA32-A
* Touch Screen 64 * 128 LGM12864B
* A Simple Buzzer
